= Programmer

Mizer has a classic programmer workflow for creating and storing looks.

You can select fixtures in the btn:[Fixtures] tab, in the btn:[2D Plan] tab or using the groups in the btn:[Presets] tab.
The selected fixtures will be highlighted in the btn:[Fixtures] tab.

In the btn:[Programmer] (kbd:[Ctrl + P]) pane on the bottom you can control the different parameters of the selected fixtures.

== Actions

=== Highlight

The btn:[Highlight] (kbd:[Home]) action will highlight the currently selected fixtures.
Highlighting always overrides values entered in the programmer.

=== Store

The btn:[Store] (kbd:[Insert]) action will open the Store dialog where the current programmer state can be persisted into a Group, Preset or Sequence.

==== Store Mode: Group

When storing into a group the current fixture selection including the selection order and any settings made in the btn:[Selection] pane will be stored as well.

==== Store Mode: Sequence

When storing into a sequence the whole programmer state will be stored into the selected or new sequence.

This includes

* Fixture Selection
* Applied values
* Selected presets
* Applied effects

==== Store Mode: Preset

When storing into a preset you can select between *Intensity*, *Shutter*, *Color* and *Position* Presets.

Each preset type will only store the channels relevant for the given type from the programmer.

== Tabs

The Programmer pane is split into multiple tabs:

=== Dimmer

The dimmer section contains controls for the shutter and the dimmer channel.

=== Position

The position section contains controls for the pan and tilt channels.

=== Gobo

The gobo sections contains controls for the gobo wheel and the gobo rotation.

=== Color

The color section contains controls for the color wheel and RGB color mixing.

=== Beam

The beam section contains controls for the beam parameters like focus, zoom and iris.

=== Channels

The channels section contains all fixture controls that cannot be categorized into the other sections.

These might be control channels for fixture behavior, reset or lamp control.

=== Effects

The effects section will contain controls for any effects applied to the current fixture section.
The Rate control will control the speed of the effect.
The Offset control will control the phase of the effect.

== Live/Offline Mode

The Programmer can be switched into offline mode by the toggle in the top right of the programmer pane.

When the programmer is offline it will *never* output anything to the fixtures.
This is helpful when creating looks live without the audience noticing.

You are currently not able to see the output of an offline programmer in the btn:[2D Plan] view. You will only see the entered values in the btn:[Fixtures] view.
