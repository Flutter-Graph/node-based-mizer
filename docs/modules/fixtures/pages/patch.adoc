== Default Values

There is currently no built in support for default values in the fixture module.
However, you can use the xref:nodes:fixtures/fixture-control/index.adoc[Fixture Control Node] or xref:nodes:fixtures/group-control/index.adoc[Group Control Node] with the lowest priority to set default values.
