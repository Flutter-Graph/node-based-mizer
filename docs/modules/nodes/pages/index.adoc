= Nodes

The Core of Mizer is the Node Graph which connects all other sub-systems.
Almost all aspects of the software can be controlled via Nodes.

Controlling a sequence for example can be done by connecting a xref:nodes:none/sequencer/index.adoc[Sequencer Node] to a xref:nodes:connections/midi-input/index.adoc[MIDI Input Node].
