== 2. Create dial

Double click or right click to create a new xref:nodes:controls/dial/index.adoc[Dial node].

.Create Dial Node

Now is a good time to give this node a good name as it will be used later in the layout view.

Select the new node and press btn:[Rename Node] (kbd:[Ctrl + R]) to give it a new name.

NOTE: Here you could also select other channels like shutter, pan or assign a rgb color.

== 4. Connect the dial to the group control node

Drag from the Output port of the dial node to the Value port of the group control node.

== 5. Add dial to the layout view

Open the btn:[Layout] view (kbd:[F1]).

To add the dial right click on the layout view and select the dial node you created in step 2.

.Add Dial to Layout

The dial won't have a label after creation. To add a label right click the dial and select btn:[Rename] to assign a label.

.Result

== 6. (Optional) Assign a midi fader to the dial

If you have a midi controller connected to your computer you can assign the dial to a midi fader.

Go back to the btn:[Nodes] view and create a new xref:nodes:connections/midi-input/index.adoc[Midi Input node].

Select the new node and in the properties pane select the midi controller as well as the fader you want to assign.

Assign the Output port of the Midi Input node to the Input port of the Dial node.

If you now open the btn:[Layout] view again you should see the dial turn when you move the midi fader.
