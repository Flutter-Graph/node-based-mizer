= Project Management

Projects are stored as `.yml` files. They contain all project related information except for the fixture profiles. This means you need to have the required fixture profiles installed on the target system to open a project.

NOTE: I'm currently working on a new file format which will also include fixture profiles, media files and possibly app settings.
